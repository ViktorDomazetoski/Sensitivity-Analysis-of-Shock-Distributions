# Sensitivity Analysis of Shock Distributions in the World Economy

## Overview

This project is part of a collaboration between researchers from the [Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts](http://manu.edu.mk/), the [Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/en) at the
Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje and [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/).

## Features

The purpose of the project is to model the network interconnectedness of countries according to the latest 2016 release of the [World Inputâ€“Output Database (WIOD)](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/valuechain/wiod/wiod-2016-release) and assess the shock distributions across the world economy by quantifying the changes in the network linkages using sensitivity analysis. We introduce a shock matrix which can be used to evaluate the impact of link sensitivity and can be used to obtain results at various levels of granularity. Taking advantage of the time-series nature of the WIOD, our results reveal illustrative visualizations that characterize patterns of shock distribution and relationships among countries throughout the period from 2000 to 2014.

## Installation

The code is available as Jupyter notebooks. The easiest way to use the notebooks is to upload them to and run them in [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory). The notebooks contain imports of the necessary Python libraries. There are no dependencies and no additional modules or libraries need to be installed. The notebooks have also been tested with a local installation of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
